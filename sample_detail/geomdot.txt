In a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.

With dot-density binning, the bin positions are determined by the data and binwidth, which is the maximum width of each bin. 

With histodot binning, the bins have fixed positions and fixed widths, much like a histogram.

When binning along the x axis and stacking along the y axis, the numbers on y axis are not meaningful, due to technical limitations of ggplot2. You can hide the y axis, as in one of the examples, or manually scale it to match the number of dots.
