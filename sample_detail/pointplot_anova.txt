The three-way ANOVA is a statistical test used to determine the effect of three nominal predictor variables on a continuous outcome variable. A three-way ANOVA test analyzes the effect of the independent variables on the expected outcome along with their relationship to the outcome itself. Random factors would be considered to have no statistical influence on a data set, while systematic factors would be considered to have statistical significance.
