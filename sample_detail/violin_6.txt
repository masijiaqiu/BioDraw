A violin plot plays a similar role as a box and whisker plot. It shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one (or more) categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared. Unlike a box plot, in which all of the plot components correspond to actual datapoints, the violin plot features a kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution.

"title"="violin plot"[string](Set title for figure.)
*"x"=[name of variables in data](Inputs for plotting long-form data. Set the x-axis varible.)
*"y"=[name of variables in data](Inputs for plotting long-form data. Set the y-axis varible.)
*"hue"=[name of variables in data](Inputs for plotting long-form data. Classfy varivles by hue value.)
"palette"="muted"[seaborn color palette or dict](Colors to use for the different levels of the hue variable. Should be something that can be interpreted by color_palette(), or a dictionary mapping hue levels to matplotlib colors.)
"scale"="count"["area"|"count"|"width"](The method used to scale the width of each violin. If area, each violin will have the same area. If count, the width of the violins will be scaled by the number of observations in that bin. If width, each violin will have the same width.)
"inner"="stick"["box"|"stick"|"point"|"quartile"](Representation of the datapoints in the violin interior. If box, draw a miniature boxplot. If quartiles, draw the quartiles of the distribution. If point or stick, show each underlying datapoint. Using None will draw unadorned violins.)
